# Overview

This repository contains the solutions to the first two problems of Advent of Code 2024. The goal of this project is to solve these problems using JavaScript and follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to ensure quality and correctness in the solutions.

The program allows the user to choose whether they want to run the solution for Problem 1 or Problem 2 directly from the console.
